# CS220P_Project5
This project is designed to evaluate a postfix expression assuming each number is 1 digit and the expression
is in valid postfix format. It inputs a postfix expression and returns the result by printing it. It computes the
result by pushing numbers into a stack and then taking out the first two numbers and combining it with an operator
when it is encountered in the expression. The expression is read as a string and it reads from left to right each
character which is either an operand or operator. When it parses the entire expression, the final result is
printed to the console window after compiling and running the program.
